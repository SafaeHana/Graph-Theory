# Graph Theory GUI
Welcome to the Graph Theory GUI! This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to interact with various graph theory algorithms and explore different types of graphs.

## Features
- Graph Order and Type Selection: Through a graphical menu, you can choose the order and type of your graph (e.g. directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted).
- Graph Characteristics: The GUI displays various characteristics of the selected graph, including its diameter, density, connectivity, completeness, and regularity.
- Algorithm Execution: The GUI allows you to run a selection of graph theory algorithms, including Prim's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, BFS, DFS, Warshall's algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.
## Getting Started
To get started with the Graph Theory GUI, simply download the project and run the main script. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired graph and algorithm options.

## Requirements
The Graph Theory GUI requires Python3 and the following libraries to be installed on your machine:

- tkinter: for creating the GUI interface
- numpy: for generating random graphs
- networkx: for graph manipulation and analysis
## Credits
The Graph Theory GUI was developed by [-Safae Mazozi - Ouidad Oualhaj].
